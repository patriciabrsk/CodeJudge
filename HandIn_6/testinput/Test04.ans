You know that I am called the *&#$%
Because I really love to *&#$%
I could sit and *&#$% all day
Sometimes I get carried away

I *&#$% slowly, slowly, slowly getting faster
Once I've started to *&#$% it's really hard to stop
Faster, faster. It is so exciting!
I could *&#$% forever, *&#$% until I drop

1! 2! 3! 4!
1-2-3-4, 1-2-3-4,
1-2, i love to *&#$% whatever the ammount haha!
1-2-3-4, heyyayayay heyayayay that's the sound of the *&#$%!

I *&#$% the spiders on the wall.
I *&#$% the cobwebs in the hall.
I *&#$% the candles on the shelf.
When I'm alone, I *&#$% myself!

I *&#$% slowly, slowly, slowly getting faster
Once I've started to *&#$% it's really hard to stop
Faster, faster. It is so exciting!
I could *&#$% forever, *&#$% until I drop

1! 2! 3! 4!
1-2-3-4, 1-2-3-4, 1,
2 I love to *&#$% whatever the
Ammount! 1-2-3-4 heyayayay heayayay 1-2-3-4
That's the song of the *&#$%!
